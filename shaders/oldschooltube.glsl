	Oldschool Tube
	--------------

	An oldschool tube effect, with a few extra lines to bump it and light it up. Virtually 
    no different in concept to the more compact, minimal character versions.

	Aiekick asked about cylindrically wrapping a pattern - like Voronoi - onto a cyclinder, 
    so  I thought I'd put a simple example together and post it privately... However, I got
    a little carried away adding window dressing. It's still not particularly interesting, 
    but I liked the simple rendering style, so thought I'd release it publicly.

	Having said that, one minor point of interest is that the edging is done in the bump 
    routine. Most edging examples are raymarched and involved normal-based edge calculations,
    but this shows that you can have edging on the bump mapped part of the scene too. There 
    are much more interesting applications, and I'll give an example at a later date.
